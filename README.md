In this project, let's perform **Fetch and Routing** by applying the concepts we have learned till now.
React Assignment
Brisphere is a workation platform that helps people with remote jobs travel while working full time. They need a website to allow users to book their stay in Ladakh. 

Task
Build a react website in typescript as shown in this pdf. It should be a fully responsive website. The order form should also be functional. Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ (or a similar platform) to make fake API calls. The order form should use redux toolkit.


Note: 
1. Instead of typescript you can use react in javascript.
2. Usage of Redux toolkit is optional




> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
